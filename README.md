# Objective function for the RNA folding problem

This project evaluates RNA secondary structures by estimating Gibbs free energy.  It uses a simplified approach based on interatomic distance frequencies and pre-calculated scoring profiles.

## Overview

The project consists of three main parts:

1. **Training:** Trains the objective function by using interatomic distance and generates scoring profiles from known PDB structures.
2. **scoring.py:** Calculate score profiles following interatomic distances.
3. **Evaluation:** Estimates Gibbs free energy for predicted structures.
4. **Plotting:** Visualizes the scoring profiles.

## Usage

### 1. **Training:**
```bash
   python training.py
```
Configure **RNA_pdb_folder** and **output_folder** in training.py.
**Output:** Frequency profiles (text files).

### 2. **Scoring:**
```bash
   python scoring.py
```
Set the frequency_directory and output_directory in **scoring.py**. This script calculates scores from the frequency profiles generated by **training.py**.

### 3. Evaluation:
```bash

python evaluate.py
```
Set pdb_file and scores directory in evaluate.py.

### 4. Plotting:
```bash

    python plot_profiles.py
```
 Set scores_directory and output_directory in plot_profiles.py.

**Files**

    training.py: Generates scoring profiles.
    evaluate.py: Evaluates structures.
    plot_profiles.py: Creates plots.
    pdb_processing.py: Reads PDB files.

**Data**

   PDB files should be placed in the directory specified by RNA_pdb_folder in training.py.
   Scoring profiles (output from training.py) should be used as input for evaluate.py and plot_profiles.py.

**Requirements**

    Python 3
    matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
